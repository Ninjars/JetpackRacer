# Jetpack Racer

An endless runner game drawn using Jetpack Compose's canvas.

This will partially be an experiment in seeing whether a flow of view state updates can be
used for a real-time game - at least for simple scenarios - or if the overhead of mapping
state every frame from game to view isn't viable.
